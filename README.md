# Open data set of blink EEG signals

This data set contains a total of 1500 samples. These samples are separated into 2 classes which are short blinks and long blinks.Each class has a total of 500 samples. It should be noted that all the data found in this data set are not filtered.

For data capture, each of the subjects was asked to blink for a duration of 2 seconds. With these blinks, a total of 10 sets were assembled, each one consisting of 50 samples per class. The classes that were used to build the data set are thus called short blinks and long blinks. Some subjects may have variations in the frequency and energy of the blink EEG signals. Therefore, some extra data that was added to the sample of each subject was: age, weight, height, if he was tired or rested.
